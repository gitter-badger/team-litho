          What is the benefits of technology today? At the medical level,
          technology can help treat more sick people and consequently save many
          lives and combat very harmful viruses and bacteria. The invention of
          the computer was a very important point. Communication is thus
          enhanced, and companies can communicate more easily with foreign
          countries.
